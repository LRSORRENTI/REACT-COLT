      <h2>What is React?</h2>
      <p>
        React is a popular front-end framework / library that's developed and
        sponsored by Facebook
      </p>
      <p class="display-4 mb-4">The main point of React is to:</p>
      <table id="t1" class="table d-flex display-5 justify-content-center">
        <thead></thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">1</th>
            <td>Make it easy to create reusable "view components"</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">2</th>
            <td>These "encapsulate logic and HTML into a class"</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">3</th>
            <td colspan="2">
              Often makes it easier to build modular applications
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-6">
      <p>
        React apps are made up of smaller components and built up until we ahve
        a full size application, we use the tools React provides to build these
        components
      </p>
      <h2>Front end frameworks:</h2>
      <p>
        Front end frameworks are larger than a library, for example we can have
        a libraary for setting date and time, and we plug that library into the
        framework, the framework provides the structure / blueprint, and you add
        the rest
      </p>
      <p>
        They are often 'opinionated' meaning you have to follow the rules of the
        framework, which can often be restricting depending on what your goals
        are. This is often referred to as 'inversion of control', with a
        library, you're in control of the structure, with a framework, the
        framework has control
      </p>
      <p>
        Frameworks often provide code for reuse inside the framework, as well 
        as providing templating of HTML
      </p>
      <p>
        The main frameworks are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Angular
            </li>
            <li>
                Vue
            </li>
            <li>
                Ember
            </li>
            <li>
                React??
            </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are dozens of frameworks out there, those 4 are 
        the most popular
      </p>
      <p>
        React does less 'out of the box' than a tradtional framework, but 
        when most developers utilize React, they're also using React 
        specific tools alongside
      </p>
      <p>
        Things like: React Router, Redux, Remix, there's a lot 
        of of React tools available for use, and there's almost a 
        'standardized stack' for developing React
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
          <h2 class="justify-content-center">
            Library or Framework?
          </h2>
          <p>
           So at face value React is a library, on it's own.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, few people use React just by itself, it's almost 
            always combined with things like React Router, Webpack etc..
          </p>
          <p>
            So when React is used in conjunction with tools like React Router,
            Redux, Webpack, React becomes an 'Ecosystem Framework'
          </p>
          <p>
            But there's also Next.js which is an actual framework built around 
            React
          </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-4">
        <h2>
            Components
        </h2>
        <p>
            Let's talk about components, components are the main building 
            block of React, React is about creating these components and 
            structuring how these components communicate with each other, 
            pass data bewteen one another
        </p>
        <p>
            Components let you split the User Interface into independent, 
            reuasble peices, and think about each peice in isolation
        </p>
        <p>
        Components usually combine peices of UI and JavaScript logic, for 
        example the first component we'll look at is the rating component, 
        where you can click a number of stars out of four or five and the 
        page will update based on the selection
        </p>
        <p>
            Components usually have classes that will render themselves 
            into HTML on the page
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-4">
      <h2>
        Looking at a large app
      </h2>
      <p>
        If we're working on a large project, our file structure will have many 
        different JavaScript files, 10-30 or however many, but each of our components 
        is localized inside it's own unique file, so our SRC folder will have 
        a LOT of files inside
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, we can have a navbar component, that we use in different places 
        in our react app, but the navbar can be a little different depending on 
        where it is, so we have our navbar js file component, and we can reuse it, 
        tweak it, and change it depending on where and how we want to
      </p>
      <p>
        The main takeaway is that in a react app, we can have components that 
        structure our webpage, we can have a default slate, like a navbar 
        component, and we can take that navbar component and customize it depending 
        on where the user is in our application, so we could have one central navbar 
        uncustomized, then take that navbar component and use it in 3 or however many unique 
        locations, changing how the navbar looks and functions each time
      </p>
