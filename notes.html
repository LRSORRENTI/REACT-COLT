      <h2>What is React?</h2>
      <p>
        React is a popular front-end framework / library that's developed and
        sponsored by Facebook
      </p>
      <p class="display-4 mb-4">The main point of React is to:</p>
      <table id="t1" class="table d-flex display-5 justify-content-center">
        <thead></thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">1</th>
            <td>Make it easy to create reusable "view components"</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">2</th>
            <td>These "encapsulate logic and HTML into a class"</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">3</th>
            <td colspan="2">
              Often makes it easier to build modular applications
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-6">
      <p>
        React apps are made up of smaller components and built up until we have
        a full size application, we use the tools React provides to build these
        components
      </p>
      <h2>Front end frameworks:</h2>
      <p>
        Front end frameworks are larger than a library, for example we can have
        a library for setting date and time, and we plug that library into the
        framework, the framework provides the structure / blueprint, and you add
        the rest
      </p>
      <p>
        They are often 'opinionated' meaning you have to follow the rules of the
        framework, which can often be restricting depending on what your goals
        are. This is often referred to as 'inversion of control', with a
        library, you're in control of the structure, with a framework, the
        framework has control
      </p>
      <p>
        Frameworks often provide code for reuse inside the framework, as well 
        as providing templating of HTML
      </p>
      <p>
        The main frameworks are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Angular
            </li>
            <li>
                Vue
            </li>
            <li>
                Ember
            </li>
            <li>
                React??
            </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are dozens of frameworks out there, those 4 are 
        the most popular
      </p>
      <p>
        React does less 'out of the box' than a tradtional framework, but 
        when most developers utilize React, they're also using React 
        specific tools alongside
      </p>
      <p>
        Things like: React Router, Redux, Remix, there's a lot 
        of of React tools available for use, and there's almost a 
        'standardized stack' for developing React
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
          <h2 class="justify-content-center">
            Library or Framework?
          </h2>
          <p>
           So at face value React is a library, on it's own.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, few people use React just by itself, it's almost 
            always combined with things like React Router, Webpack etc..
          </p>
          <p>
            So when React is used in conjunction with tools like React Router,
            Redux, Webpack, React becomes an 'Ecosystem Framework'
          </p>
          <p>
            But there's also Next.js which is an actual framework built around 
            React
          </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-4">
        <h2>
            Components
        </h2>
        <p>
            Let's talk about components, components are the main building 
            block of React, React is about creating these components and 
            structuring how these components communicate with each other, 
            pass data bewteen one another
        </p>
        <p>
            Components let you split the User Interface into independent, 
            reuasble peices, and think about each peice in isolation
        </p>
        <p>
        Components usually combine peices of UI and JavaScript logic, for 
        example the first component we'll look at is the rating component, 
        where you can click a number of stars out of four or five and the 
        page will update based on the selection
        </p>
        <p>
            Components usually have classes that will render themselves 
            into HTML on the page
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container mt-4">
      <h2>
        Looking at a large app
      </h2>
      <p>
        If we're working on a large project, our file structure will have many 
        different JavaScript files, 10-30 or however many, but each of our components 
        is localized inside it's own unique JavaScript file, so our SRC folder will have 
        a LOT of files inside
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, we can have a navbar component, that we use in different places 
        in our react app, but the navbar can be a little different depending on 
        where it is, so we have our navbar js file component, and we can reuse it, 
        tweak it, and change it depending on where and how we want to
      </p>
      <p>
        The main takeaway is that in a react app, we can have components that 
        structure our webpage, we can have a default slate, like a navbar 
        component, and we can take that navbar component and customize it depending 
        on where the user is in our application, so we could have one central navbar 
        uncustomized, then take that navbar component and use it in 3 or however many unique 
        locations, changing how the navbar looks and functions each time
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Setting up our server</h2>
      <p>
        Normally we'd use a command in the terminal 'create-react-app' which 
        takes care of a lot of details for us, but it's useful to know how to 
        set things up the 'old-fashioned' way
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll add a single HTML file, we'll add in a script manually,
        but the caveat is that we NEED a server, and what we'll use in this 
        course is the liveServer extension in VSCODE</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>
        Components
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Writing our first component
      </h3>
      <p>
        It's time to write our first React component, but there'll be 
        hundreds we'll write throughout the course, but this one will be the 
        simplest
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two ways to write components in React, one way is using classes, 
        and the other is using functions
      </p>
      <p>
        But for this first component we're going to use class
      </p>
      <p>
        Also keep in mind, we're not going to be creating our React 
        apps this way for long, soon we'll be exclusively utilizing 
        the 'create-react-app' tool
      </p>
      <p>
         First up, in our html we must include react, we 
         do this by including the following inside of 
         script tags INSIDE the body, but at the bottom, and remember 
         the order that we put them DOES MATTER
      </p>
<p>
        First script tag:
      </p>
      <p>
        src="https://unpkg.com/react/umd/react.development.js"
      </p>
      <p>
        Second script tag:
      </p>
      <p>
        src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom/umd/react-dom.development.sj"
      </p>
      <p>
        Third script tag:
      </p>
      <p>
        src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone"
      </p>
      <p>
        Fourth script tag: 
      </p>
      <p>
        src="index.js" type="text/jsx"
      </p>
      <p>
        We're using cdn to link here, but we could download these, 
        and link to them locally, but we're not going to stress it 
        since shortly we'll be only using the create-react-app tool
      </p>
      <p>
        HEADS UP!!! The links above for react are deprecated, I think 
        the babel unpkg links work, but I needed to go to the official 
        React website and add new CDN links for it to work
</p>
<p>
 crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js">
 </p>
 <p>
crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js">
</p>
      <p>
        The third script tag is for babel, babel allows us to 
        write html inside our JavaScript, jsx is not valid normally, 
        so babel transpiles it to valid JavaScript, babel comes 
        in clutch here for us
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally we just need to link to our index.js file or whichever 
        file we're creating our component, notice though we need to 
        append after src="index.js" type="text/jsx", this 
        is required, without this it will not work
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>
        Fully set up
      </h2>
      <p>
        Now we've got our index.html done, after those script tags 
        are added in that specific order in the body, and we have our 
        'root' div above them we're good to go
      </p>
      <p>
        Every single class component we create will be:
      </p>
      <p>
        class Something extends React.Component{
      </p>
      <p>
        render() {
      </p>
      <p>
        return < h1 >Hello, {this.props.name} < /h1> 
      </p>
      <p>}</p>
      <p>}</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
      Also note with the render method, we can only return 
      one type of html tag per render, if we wanted to render 
      multiple h1 tags or paragraph tags we'd need to:
      </p>
      <p>
        render() {
      </p>
      <p>
        return (
      </p>
      <p>
         < div> 
      </p>
      <p>
        < h1 > hello there < / h1 >
      </p>
      <p>
        < h1 > hello there < / h1 >
      </p>
      <p>
       < p > I am jsx  < / p> 
       </p>
       <p>
        < p > I am jsx< / p> 
        </p>
        <p>
          < /div >
        </p>
        <p>
          );
        </p>
        <p>
        }
        </p>
        <p>
        }
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
      The above would work now, we can render multiple of 
      the same tag, but we must wrap them in a div!
      </p>
      <p>
        That's a very simple component, but all components will 
        follow a similar structure, we include our CDN links, ESPECIALLY 
        BABEL, and our 'type="text/jsx"' then inside of our JavaScript
        file we can write html! And using the ReactDom.render() to 
        add html to our page FROM a JavaScript file
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>
        Function component
      </h2>
      <p>
        We just wrote our first class component, but 
        we can also write function components
      </p>
      <p>
        A Class component is the traditional React 
        component, we write our logic inside of a JS class, 
        and we MUST include the render() method
      </p>
      <p>
        Function components are usually used for simpler, more 
        basic components
      </p>
      <p>
        They don't have the same capabilities as class components,
        and there's no render method needed, just the function 
        return statement
      </p>
      <p>
        function Dog()
      </p>
      <p>
        {
      </p>
      <p>
        return '< p > German Shepherd, Cava-Corgi < / p >''
      </p>
      <p>
      }
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
        So what's the main difference?
      </p>
      <p>
        Both can accept props and render content to the page
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically function components couldn't utitlize 'state' 
        and 'lifecycle methods'
      </p>
      <p>
        With the introduction of Hooks, we can write full-featured 
        function components, which will dive into later!
      </p>
      <p>
        For now though, we'll focus on the traditional class
        based components, that way we can only worry about 
        one kind of syntax for now, and of course, we'll deep 
        dive into Hooks later in the course!
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary we can render things to our page with both class, and 
        function components, but function components are usually utilized 
        for simpler tasks
      </p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>
        Introducing: JSX
      </h2>
      <p>
        This section we'll learn about JSX which stands for JavaScript
        Syntax Xtension, or JavaScript + XML
      </p>
      <p>
        JSX is the tool that allows us to write HTML looking code 
        inside of a JavaScript file, there's a lot going on 
        behind the scenes with BABEL turning the HTML characters 
        in JSX to valid JS code
      </p>
      <p>
        It's possible to create React applications without 
        JSX but it's more time-consuming and results in more code 
        needing to be written
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>
        JSX is NOT legal JavaScript
        </h2>
        <p>it has to be transpiled to 
        valid JavaScript using Babel
      </p>
      <h2>
        JSX Rules
      </h2>
      <p>
        JSX is more strict than HTML -- elements must either 
        have an explicit closing tag, or be self-closed, the '/'
        is critical, otherwise we'll always get a syntax error
      </p>
      <p>
        And remember is we want to render multiple elements 
        in a single component, they need to be inside of a div tag, 
        or a section tags
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>
        Embedding JS Expressions in JSX
      </h2>
      <p>
        We can embed JavaScript functions or other data-types using 
        curly braces nested inside our html tag and inside render(), this works just like 
        JavaScript but passing it in the render as an expression
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>
        Conditionals in JSX
      </h2>
      <p>
        We can also add conditional logic inside of our JSX, 
        how we can display things selectively depending on 
        certain conditions
      </p>
      <p>
        The exercise showed how we can use if/else, ternary operators to 
        display messaging depending on the condition, for smaller 
        conditional checks the ternary works well, for larger 
        conditional checks implementing if /else works
      </p>
      <p>
        There are other ways to structure these conditional 
        checks to inject data into our webpage we'll see later

        How to Layout a React Application
      </h2>
      <p>
        In this section we'll learn how to properly 
        structure the files inside of a React application
      </p>
      <p>
        So far we HAVEN'T been following it, we've been creating a 
        single component inside of an index.js file
      </p>
      <p>
        It's proper to create a component in it's own file, 
        with a filename that is obvious at a glance what the 
        component is.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if we have a greeting component, we create a 
        file called greet.js, if we have a number picker, 
        we create a numpicker.js file 
      </p>
      <p>
        One component per file. If our app has 5 compoments, 
        we have 5 js files, if it has 10 components we have 
        10 js files, all should have obvious naming as to 
        what the component is doing, 
      </p>

      <p>
        Then after we have our components in separate 
        files that have obvious names, we create our App
        component, and our App component is where we utilize 
        our separate js component files into a single element
      </p>
      <p>
        So we'd have our main App component that will be 
        the top-level component, which renders all of the 
        applications individual / separate compoments
      </p>
      <p>
        This way it's easier to read the App code, and 
        it's almost always the only thing rendered in the main 
        index.js
      </p>
      <p>
        And like always the ORDER OF THE SCRIPT TAGS are 
        vitally important
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
        So when we make a react application, we'll always 
        separate our components into their own unique js 
        files, then in our main index.js, where we have our 'class 
        App extends React.Component', inside the render we 
        add our components that we want to render, keeping 
        them separate
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>
        Intro to REACT PROPS AKA PROPERTIES
      </h2>
      <p>
        Props or properties allow us to make components more 
        customizable, configurable AND resuable!
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, with our last Greet component, we can add props 
        that will be given for 'to': or who we are greeting, and 
        'from': who is greeting us. Hello Luke, From Rene
      </p>
      <p>
        Just finished the exercise, we can use '{this.prop.key}' 
        to like in JS template literals, pass in values, we 
        can also to shorten it do:
      </p>
      <p>
        const prop = this.props, then '{this.prop.key}' becomes:
      </p>
      <p>
        {props.key}
      </p>
      <p>
        And the '.key' being what we defined inside the main index.js, 
        render function as key value pairs, like inside of an object
      </p>
      <p>
        < Hello to:"Luke" from:"Rene", so like an object, 
        'to' is the key, and "Luke" is the value
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Props are immutable?</h2>
      <p>
        This is crucial! Properties are for configuring 
        your component, but these properties are immutable, they 
        cannot change
      </p>
      <p>
        That doesn't mean components can't be altered, we just can't do it 
        through props
      </p>
      <p>
        This will be more obvious when we get into things like 'state', 
        rendering and re-rendering
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>
        Other types of Props
      </h2>
      <p>
        So far all our properties have been strings, but we pass 
        in other data-types as well, numbers, booleans, arrays using, 
        curly braces to embed them 
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also pass in images, using an img tag as a prop, then 
        in the component file we do : < img src={this.props.img} / >
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>
        Looping in JSX
      </h2>
      <p>
        We've seen how to embed variables, and add conditional 
        logic in JSX so far, but now we need to learn how 
        to loop in JSX
      </p>
      <p>
        The most common way is to use the .map() to output loops in JSX
      </p>
